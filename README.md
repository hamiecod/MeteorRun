# Introduction
This is an obstacle game involving a dinosaur as the protagonist and the meteors as the obstacles, the dinosaur has to save itself from dying by the metoers. This game is made only using HTML, SCSS and vanilla Javascript. This game is somewhat similar to obstacle games like subway surfers, temple run, etc.
